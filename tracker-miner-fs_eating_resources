Simply change this values using the gsettings witch will disable the constant indexing of Tracker:


gsettings set org.freedesktop.Tracker.Miner.Files crawling-interval -2
gsettings set org.freedesktop.Tracker.Miner.Files enable-monitors false

The values could be changed using dconf-editor by navigating through org > freedesktop > Tracker > Miner > Files:

After this changes, it is highly recommended to cleanup the database to reclaim some lost space on the disk:

tracker-control -r
